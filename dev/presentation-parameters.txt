Hey everyone. I've create a quick video describing an event we intend to run through our website at the end of the month.

Called

Enterprise Analytics Summit

I've detailed everything in the below video.

Really keen to get all of you or anyone of you involved!

Here's a quick summary.................

We may make this a quarterly thing. Really make a big deal out of it. And its where we bring all our experts in to create a session each.
 
So sessions from experts should be anything about analytics. 30-50 mins long each. All recorded prior to the event. No editing of the videos. Expert should just press record and talk about anything cool or interesting around what they are doing or there expertise.
 
I want this to be super easy for experts.
 
They can re-purpose existing content created
Discuss a challenge submission
Discuss any interesting technique they think would be useful
Discuss anything to do with analytics
Talk about any technique or feature in Power BI and Power Platform
They can really talk about anything that would be valuable and interesting to our audience
They can do a joint session with anyone on these topics


All you have to do is record a session about anything you like and we'll look after the rest.

Event dates 24th-26th Nov.

Session recordings ready before 19th November

Any questions let me know

@Shiela will be completing all the co-ordination for us at Enterprise DNA

Myself and Brian are available to discuss.
